# Context
We will focus on integrating two data sources from NYC Taxi data: one from 2015 and the second from 2023. The table below presents the metaphors we will use to integrate the data:
![Data overview](../screenshots/1/data-integration-one.png)

Tasks Overview:
* Data Ingestion: Initiate by loading historical data assets from the year 2015, a period when Azure Blob Storage was the zenith of data storage solutions. This step will simulate the transition of legacy data into a modern data ecosystem.
* Data Integration and Analysis: Shift focus to more recent data, specifically from January 2023. During this time, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 (ADLS Gen2) became the benchmark for data storage in Azure. Instead of traditional data copying methods, you will leverage the innovative `Shortcuts` feature to streamline the integration process within our Lakehouse architecture.

By the end of the workshop, we will have completed the first step, the bronze layer, of the medallion architecture:

Microsoft Fabric lakehouses are designed to provide data engineers and analysts with the benefits of both data lake storage and a relational data warehouse. Apache Spark is a critical technology for big data analytics, and its support within Microsoft Fabric allows you to seamlessly integrate Spark's big data processing capabilities with the other data analytics and visualization tools available on the platform. 
By using a lakehouse, you can create an end-to-end data analytics solution that includes data ingestion, transformation, modeling, and visualization. The lakehouse provides a unified and scalable platform for storing and managing data, allowing you to easily access and analyze both structured and unstructured data. Additionally, the platform's built-in security and compliance features help ensure that your data is always secure and compliant with industry standards.


**The foundation of Microsoft Fabric is a Lakehouse**, which is built on top of the **OneLake** scalable storage layer and uses **Apache Spark** and **SQL** compute engines for big data processing. A Lakehouse is a unified platform that combines:
- The flexible and scalable storage of a data lake
- The ability to query and analyze data of a data warehouse

Some benefits of a lakehouse include:
- Lakehouses use Spark and SQL engines to process large-scale data and support machine learning or predictive modeling analytics.
- Lakehouse data is organized in a schema-on-read format, which means you define the schema as needed rather than having a predefined schema.
- Lakehouses support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions through Delta Lake formatted tables for data consistency and integrity.
- Lakehouses are a single location for data engineers, data scientists, and data analysts to access and use data.

A Lakehouse is a great option if you want a scalable analytics solution that maintains data consistency.

Imagine your company has been storing structured data from NYC Taxi's transactional system, such as trip history, passenger counts, and fare information in a data warehouse. However, you have also collected unstructured data from social media, website logs, and third-party sources related to NYC Taxi, which are difficult to manage and analyze using the existing data warehouse infrastructure.

Your company's new directive is to improve its decision-making capabilities by analyzing data in various formats across multiple sources. Therefore, the company decides to **leverage Microsoft Fabric's capabilities to analyze and manage these diverse datasets more efficiently**.


When creating shortcuts in a lakehouse, you must understand the folder structure of the item. Lakehouses are composed of two top level folders: the Tables folder and the Files folder. The Tables folder represents the managed portion of the lakehouse, while the Files folder is the unmanaged portion of the lakehouse. In the Tables folder, you can only create shortcuts at the top level. Shortcuts aren't supported in other subdirectories of the Tables folder. If the target of the shortcut contains data in the Delta\Parquet format, the lakehouse automatically synchronizes the metadata and recognizes the folder as a table. In the Files folder, there are no restrictions on where you can create shortcuts. You can create them at any level of the folder hierarchy. Table discovery doesn't happen in the Files folder.

![Shortcuts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/media/onelake-shortcuts/lake-view-table-view.png)


## 1.2.1. **Lakehouse Modes Exploration**
You can work with the data in the lakehouse in two modes:

1. Lake mode enables you to add and interact with tables, files, and folders in the Lakehouse.
2. **SQL Endpoint enables you to use SQL to query the tables in the lakehouse and manage its relational data model. It allows you to run Transact-SQL statements to query, filter, aggregate, and otherwise explore data in lakehouse tables.**

Fabric's data warehouse experience allows you to transition from the lake view of the Lakehouse (which supports data engineering and Apache Spark) to the SQL experiences that a traditional data warehouse would provide.

![Step](../screenshots/1/27.jpg)

## 1.2.2. **Explore Lakehouse Properties**
In the `Tables` section of your Lakehouse, click the three dots next to your table name and select `Properties` from the dropdown menu.
![Step](../screenshots/1/28.jpg)

## 1.2.3. **Data Format and Management**
Observe that the table's data format is listed as `Managed`, indicating that the table is a managed entity. Also, note that this table has been optimized using Z-order optimization; further details can be found in the extra section.
![Step](../screenshots/1/29.jpg)

> [!TIP]
> Explore managed vs unmanaged tables for Fabric Spark by [reviewing an article written by our teammate Aitor, who is part of the Customer Advisory Team](https://murggu.medium.com/creating-managed-and-external-spark-tables-in-fabric-lakehouse-ef6212e75e81).

## 1.2.4. **Review Table Files**
Return to the Lakehouse overview, expand the table options, and select `Files` to examine the data. Notice that your loaded data is in Parquet format, which is now part of a Delta Lake due to the conversion process.
![Step](../screenshots/1/30.jpg)

## 1.2.5. **Final Lakehouse Overview**
Navigate back to the main Lakehouse view, expand the table options for the final time, and select `Maintenance`.
![Step](../screenshots/1/31.jpg)

## 1.2.6. **Maintenance Options and Optimization**
Here, you will find options for optimizing file size and vacuuming, which involves removing files that are no longer needed. Both processes can be automated. This section also details how Z-order optimization is applied to your data; hover over the information icon for more details.
![Step](../screenshots/1/32.jpg)

# Task 1.3 Create shortcut
This task focuses on accessing and leveraging tax data from the year 2023, enhancing our Lakehouse with critical financial insights without the overhead of traditional data movement.

Your mission is to access the 2023 tax data that has been accumulating since 1982, making it readily available for analysis and decision-making within our Lakehouse environment. The key here is efficiency and innovation, as we aim to streamline our data operations.

Task Details:
* In this task, you will utilize the `Shortcuts` feature, a powerful tool that enables direct access to data without the necessity of copying it into the Lakehouse. This approach not only saves time but also reduces storage costs and maintains data integrity by eliminating unnecessary duplication.
* By employing the `Shortcuts` strategy, you will achieve `Zero Data Movement`. This means you will directly point to the existing tax data from 2023, enabling real-time access and analysis without the overhead of traditional data transfer methods.

Benefits of This Approach:
* Efficiency: Access data in real-time without the delays associated with copying large datasets.
* Cost-effectiveness: Reduce storage costs by avoiding duplicate data in our Lakehouse.
* Data Integrity: Maintain a single source of truth by accessing data directly from its original location.

Remember, our team is here to guide you through every step of this process. Do not hesitate to reach out if you encounter any challenges or have questions about the `Shortcuts` feature and its implementation.

![Step](../screenshots/1/36.jpg)

**If you encounter the error message `The specified connection name already exists. Try choosing a different name`, please make sure that the name you choose for the connection is unique.**

## 1.3.4. Verify ADLS Gen2 Access
Ensure correct configuration by checking the folder named `2023`. Inside it, locate a Parquet file. Confirm the selection of the appropriate folder as shown on the screen, then click `Next`.

> ![!IMPORTANT]
> We are creating a demo to a folder named 2023, and you need to just observe and ack that inside that folder there is a required file (as presented on the screenshot). 

![Step](../screenshots/1/37.jpg)

## 1.3.5. Shortcut Configuration Success
Successfully configured access to your data via shortcuts, without needing to copy it. The shortcut should now appear under the `Files` section, indicating a link to a folder containing Parquet files.
![Step](../screenshots/1/38.jpg)

## 1.3.6. Load to Table (Delta Table) Parquet Data
To transform the Parquet data into a Delta table, click the three dots next to the file name as shown on the screen, then select `Load Tables`.
![Step](../screenshots/1/39.jpg)

## 1.3.7. Select and Name New Table
Choose the `New Table` option as presented on the screen and Name the new table as `green202301` as we follow [the provided naming conventions](../exercise-0-setup/naming-convention.md), then click `Load`.
![Step](../screenshots/1/40.jpg)

![Step](../screenshots/1/41.jpg)

![Step](../screenshots/1/42.jpg)

## 1.3.9. Refresh Lakehouse
After the loading process completes, refresh the Lakehouse by clicking the three dots next to the table and selecting `Refresh`. A new table should now be visible.

## 1.3.10. Open in Notebook
Notice that Fabric has generated a new notebook for you, containing the SQL to load your data from the newly created table.
![Step](../screenshots/1/43.jpg)

![Step](../screenshots/1/44.jpg)

## 1.3.11. Verify Notebook Configuration
Following the correct execution, you should observe two tables under the `Tables` section and one folder under `Files`. Confirm everything is correct, then run the cell containing the PySpark code by clicking the run icon.
![Step](../screenshots/1/45.jpg)

## 1.3.12. Execute Query
The query should execute within a few seconds, demonstrating the seamless integration and ease of use provided by Fabric as a true SaaS solution. Review the results displayed in the table.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Fabric Spark enforces a cores-based throttling and queueing mechanism, where users can submit jobs based on the purchased Fabric capacity SKUs. The queueing mechanism is a simple FIFO-based queue, which checks for available job slots and automatically retries the jobs once the capacity has become available. When users submit notebook or lakehouse jobs like Load to Table when their capacity is at its maximum utilization due to concurrent running jobs using all the Spark Vcores available for their purchased Fabric capacity SKU, they're throttled with the message **HTTP Response code 430: Unable to submit this request because all the available capacity is currently being used. The suggested solutions are to cancel a currently running job, increase the available capacity, or try again later.**.


![Step](../screenshots/1/46.jpg)

> [!WARNING]
> In Fabric, when you attach a Lakehouse to a notebook, metadata is saved in the notebook file. If you share this notebook by exporting and downloading it, the person receiving it will see a warning that it was linked to another Lakehouse. To prevent this, clear the notebook's attachments before sharing. If receiving a notebook with attachments, assign it to a new Lakehouse to avoid conflicts. 
> For CI/CD, remember that artifacts contain metadata showing their connections.
> 
> ![Step](../screenshots/1/warning.png) 

## 1.3.13. Confirm Default Lakehouse
Ensure that the `bronzerawdata` Lakehouse is set as the default for the notebook. Once confirmed, the task is successfully completed. Congratulations!
![Step](../screenshots/1/47.jpg)


## Task 1.4 Management of Spark Sessions
Learn to manage and terminate Spark sessions within your workspace to ensure efficient resource utilization and cost management.

Note that the default session expiration time for Starter and Spark Pools is set to 20 minutes. A Spark pool will be deallocated if not used for 2 minutes after session expiration.
